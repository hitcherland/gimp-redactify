Installation
============

For your system, follow plugin installation instructions [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GIMP/Installing_Plugins)

Usage
=====
Once you have installed the plugin, you will see a new menu item in <Image>/Filters/Redactify.
To use this plugin, I recommend starting a new A4 page. Then, go through each function in step.
You can see an example document by simply pressing okay at each point.
